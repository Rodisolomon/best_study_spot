Unfortunately, it fortunately (depending on how you look at it), coming in to order led me to spend more than I had intended- haha.\\nI ordered the chicken and rice soup of the day ($5.95) as well as the Avocado and tomato salad ($11.95).\\n\\nThe chicken soup was tasty. It had just the right amount of veggies and chicken to broth ratio. And it came with three small slices of baguette.\\n\\nThe avocado and tomato salad is an arugula base (my favorite kind of green), and in addition to perfectly ripened avocados and tomatoes, has cotija cheese sprinkled on top and a cilantro dressing. The only let down was the cilantro dressing. I expected something vinegary and more cilantro flavored, but this was sweet. That was definitely not what I had in mind, but I know better now and will ask if the dressings are sweet or not in the future for other salads. Apart from the surprise sweetness, the arugula was wonderfully fresh, without any wilting!\\n\\nSo, long story short, I would not get the salad again, unless I got a different dressing, but I would get the soup. And while I was seated, I saw several other things I want to try in the future‚Ä¶ specifically their sandwiches. Those baguettes look so good!\\n\\nAlso, the question I had asked was what came on the goat cheese sandwich because online said paprika and I was like it can‚Äôt just be paprika and goat cheese. I think it was an autocorrect because the staff told me it‚Äôs peppers! Hahaha. That is something I actually make at home all the time!

So I ask the cashier about it and she says \"oh yes, that\\'s not updated, you have this one up here for reference\" and points to the menu above her head. To me, that is not good service. First, please don\\'t present false prices. Print a new menu, correct it with a pen, anything.

I asked one of the good runners a question that he didn‚Äôt know the answer to, and I said that‚Äôs okay, don‚Äôt worry about it, I‚Äôll check when I go back inside.

I asked the person on the phone if they liked it, to which they responded that they did. I then asked if I could order it for pickup over the phone and they said I‚Äôd have to use one of the online ordering systems because they don‚Äôt do phone orders. Instead, I just walked over and ordered in person. Unfortunately, it fortunately (depending on how you look at it), coming in to order led me to spend more than I had intended- haha.\\nI ordered the chicken and rice soup of the day ($5.95) as well as the Avocado and tomato salad ($11.95).\\n\\nThe chicken soup was tasty. It had just the right amount of veggies and chicken to broth ratio. And it came with three small slices of baguette.\\n\\nThe avocado and tomato salad is an arugula base (my favorite kind of green), and in addition to perfectly ripened avocados and tomatoes, has cotija cheese sprinkled on top and a cilantro dressing. The only let down was the cilantro dressing. I expected something vinegary and more cilantro flavored, but this was sweet. That was definitely not what I had in mind, but I know better now and will ask if the dressings are sweet or not in the future for other salads. Apart from the surprise sweetness, the arugula was wonderfully fresh, without any wilting!\\n\\nSo, long story short, I would not get the salad again, unless I got a different dressing, but I would get the soup. And while I was seated, I saw several other things I want to try in the future‚Ä¶ specifically their sandwiches. Those baguettes look so good!\\n\\nAlso, the question I had asked was what came on the goat cheese sandwich because online said paprika and I was like it can‚Äôt just be paprika and goat cheese. I think it was an autocorrect because the staff told me it‚Äôs peppers! Hahaha. That is something I actually make at home all the time!

They have a beautiful outdoor area with tons of seating options. Today, I chose to sit at the communal long table with the planter in the middle. When it‚Äôs nice out, I will always sit here.\\n\\nStaff:\\n- the staff here are nice and go out of their way to help you. I asked one of the good runners a question that he didn‚Äôt know the answer to, and I said that‚Äôs okay, don‚Äôt worry about it, I‚Äôll check when I go back inside. Little did I know, he found someone inside that came out and answered my question. Now that‚Äôs ‚ÄúDisney quality‚Äù customer service! (When you don‚Äôt know the answer to something, you find out for the customer)\\n\\nFood:\\nI was craving soup, so I called ahead and asked what the soup of the day was. I was told chicken with rice. I asked the person on the phone if they liked it, to which they responded that they did. I then asked if I could order it for pickup over the phone and they said I‚Äôd have to use one of the online ordering systems because they don‚Äôt do phone orders. Instead, I just walked over and ordered in person. Unfortunately, it fortunately (depending on how you look at it), coming in to order led me to spend more than I had intended- haha.\\nI ordered the chicken and rice soup of the day ($5.95) as well as the Avocado and tomato salad ($11.95).\\n\\nThe chicken soup was tasty. It had just the right amount of veggies and chicken to broth ratio. And it came with three small slices of baguette.\\n\\nThe avocado and tomato salad is an arugula base (my favorite kind of green), and in addition to perfectly ripened avocados and tomatoes, has cotija cheese sprinkled on top and a cilantro dressing. The only let down was the cilantro dressing. I expected something vinegary and more cilantro flavored, but this was sweet. That was definitely not what I had in mind, but I know better now and will ask if the dressings are sweet or not in the future for other salads. Apart from the surprise sweetness, the arugula was wonderfully fresh, without any wilting!\\n\\nSo, long story short, I would not get the salad again, unless I got a different dressing, but I would get the soup. And while I was seated, I saw several other things I want to try in the future‚Ä¶ specifically their sandwiches. Those baguettes look so good!\\n\\nAlso, the question I had asked was what came on the goat cheese sandwich because online said paprika and I was like it can‚Äôt just be paprika and goat cheese. I think it was an autocorrect because the staff told me it‚Äôs peppers! Hahaha. That is something I actually make at home all the time!
