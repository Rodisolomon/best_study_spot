I overheard people studying for their bio final, and thought I would never be able to study having to speak so loudly to get my partner to hear me. But\u2026. The outside is where it\u2019s at! They have a beautiful outdoor area with tons of seating options. Today, I chose to sit at the communal long table with the planter in the middle. When it\u2019s nice out, I will always sit here.\n\nStaff:\n- the staff here are nice and go out of their way to help you. I asked one of the good runners a question that he didn\u2019t know the answer to, and I said that\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry about it, I\u2019ll check when I go back inside. Little did I know, he found someone inside that came out and answered my question. Now that\u2019s \u201cDisney quality\u201d customer service! (When you don\u2019t know the answer to something, you find out for the customer)\n\nFood:\nI was craving soup, so I called ahead and asked what the soup of the day was. I was told chicken with rice. I asked the person on the phone if they liked it, to which they responded that they did. I then asked if I could order it for pickup over the phone and they said I\u2019d have to use one of the online ordering systems because they don\u2019t do phone orders. Instead, I just walked over and ordered in person. Unfortunately, it fortunately (depending on how you look at it), coming in to order led me to spend more than I had intended- haha.\nI ordered the chicken and rice soup of the day ($5.95) as well as the Avocado and tomato salad ($11.95).\n\nThe chicken soup was tasty. It had just the right amount of veggies and chicken to broth ratio. And it came with three small slices of baguette.\n\nThe avocado and tomato salad is an arugula base (my favorite kind of green), and in addition to perfectly ripened avocados and tomatoes, has cotija cheese sprinkled on top and a cilantro dressing. The only let down was the cilantro dressing. I expected something vinegary and more cilantro flavored, but this was sweet. That was definitely not what I had in mind, but I know better now and will ask if the dressings are sweet or not in the future for other salads. Apart from the surprise sweetness, the arugula was wonderfully fresh, without any wilting!\n\nSo, long story short, I would not get the salad again, unless I got a different dressing, but I would get the soup. And while I was seated, I saw several other things I want to try in the future\u2026 specifically their sandwiches. Those baguettes look so good!\n\nAlso, the question I had asked was what came on the goat cheese sandwich because online said paprika and I was like it can\u2019t just be paprika and goat cheese. I think it was an autocorrect because the staff told me it\u2019s peppers! Hahaha. That is something I actually make at home all the time! Roasted red peppers, with goat cheese, and arugula on a baguette.

Chose to get an egg&cheese sandwich (shown as $6.00) and a side of greens (shown as $3.50). I also got an Americano. I get to the counter and see that the prices are higher. Much higher. For the sandwich, 8$, and for the greens, $6! That is 25% more for the sandwich and and almost double for the greens. So I ask the cashier about it and she says \"oh yes, that's not updated, you have this one up here for reference\" and points to the menu above her head. To me, that is not good service. First, please don't present false prices. Print a new menu, correct it with a pen, anything. By the time I got to the cashier, I just wanted to order, so I accepted the prices and hoped that at least it will be worth it. The whole order, befote tip, summed to a little over $20.\n\nI get my coffee, which was ok. Water tap doesn't work, so I ask for water. Water was warm. I get my sandwich and greens. The sandwich is what I expected. A small bun with eggs and cheese. Wouldn't pay $8 again for it, but it was ok. But the greens... A tiny container with the dressing container inside taking even more room. The amount is ridiculous. $6 for such a small amount of simple greens.\n\nI wouldn't recommend going here for more than a coffee or a muffin.

The hundreds of trees, many old growth, destroyed. The building itself blocking off major bird migration routes. It's truly criminal that they chose to build this on public park land (given to them for free by Lori) when there are countless acres of abandoned and undeveloped land across the south side. I remember there was a group of locals pushing for this to be on a vast stretch of empty land in Washington Park, where it would've been replacing concrete and cheap private land rather than destroying a vibrant ecosystem and public park.\n\nI would love to see this result in resources flooding into the local community, as it was originally framed/sold. God knows no one else has been investing in poor south side neighborhoods. If the Obamas really believe in what they say, they should be taking massive steps to protect local housing and pour resources into the community. They damn well have the money.\n\nAs it is now though, I can only see this being a massive hub of tourism, pollution, and gentrification that's already been spreading out from Hyde Park. Most of the housing on the south side is now owned by corporations, who will have no qualms evicting longtime residents to take on white folks who can pay three times as much. We've already seen it happening across Hyde Park, Bronzeville, Morgan Park, and other historic south side communities.\n\nIf anyone with a heart and some influence sees this, please tell the Obamas.
